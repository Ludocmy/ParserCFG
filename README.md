# Parser
 During one of my University modules called Functional Programming at the University of Bath I had to code a Context-Free Grammar Parser which upon input can tell wether or not the input is part of the Grammar. This was a particularly challenging and interesting problem which I enjoyed workig on. I posted how far along I got before I had too hand-in the coursework.
